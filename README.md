**Dataset**

The **CESAMARD v2** dataset is a multimodal complaint dataset which we have further extended with severity-level annotations. The dataset contains 3962 instances, 2641 of which are non-complaints, and 1321 of which are complaints. According to the linguistic definition of complaint, if a given review contains at least one complaint speech act, the complete review is interpreted as a complaint. We further annotate the complaint instances based on emotional depth through severity levels, the level of face threat involved, and the intentions behind them.
We utilize the severity classes defined in the benchmark study \textit{Interlanguage pragmatics: Requests, complaints, and apologies} by Trosberg et al. 

Following are the severity classes:

a) No explicit reproach: The complaint is of a neutral tone, and the reason for the complaint is not expressed explicitly.

b) Disapproval: Complaint explicitly shows negative emotions such as annoyance or discontent. The claim may imply that the complainant holds the complainee accountable without saying so.

c) Accusation: Complainant directly charges someone of wrongdoing.

d) Blame: Complainant holds someone responsible for wrongdoing.
